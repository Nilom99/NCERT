        <h3>Solutions to NCERT Questions</h3>

        <h4>Question 1:</h4>
        <p>What are acids?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in solution and have a sour taste.</p>

        <h4>Question 2:</h4>
        <p>What are bases?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Bases are substances that accept hydrogen ions or release hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) in solution and have a bitter taste.</p>

        <h4>Question 3:</h4>
        <p>What are salts?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Salts are compounds formed when acids react with bases, resulting in the neutralization of their properties.</p>

        <h4>Question 4:</h4>
        <p>What is the pH scale?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The pH scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 14 used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.</p>

        <h4>Question 5:</h4>
        <p>What is the significance of pH in daily life?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>pH is important in various aspects of daily life, such as maintaining soil quality for agriculture, human health, and chemical reactions.</p>

        <h4>Question 6:</h4>
        <p>What are indicators?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Indicators are substances that change color when exposed to acids or bases, used to determine the pH of a solution.</p>

        <h4>Question 7:</h4>
        <p>Give an example of a natural indicator.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Litmus is a natural indicator derived from lichens that changes color in the presence of acids (red) or bases (blue).</p>

        <h4>Question 8:</h4>
        <p>What is the reaction between an acid and a base called?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The reaction between an acid and a base is called neutralization, resulting in the formation of water and a salt.</p>

        <h4>Question 9:</h4>
        <p>What happens when an acid reacts with a metal?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>When an acid reacts with a metal, it produces hydrogen gas and a salt.</p>

        <h4>Question 10:</h4>
        <p>What are the uses of acids in daily life?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Acids have various uses, including in food preservation, cleaning agents, and battery production.</p>

        <h4>Question 11:</h4>
        <p>What is the role of bases in soap?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Bases play a crucial role in soap production through a process called saponification, which involves the reaction of fats with an alkali.</p>

        <h4>Question 12:</h4>
        <p>Explain the importance of salts in our diet.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Salts are essential for various bodily functions, including maintaining fluid balance, nerve transmission, and muscle contraction.</p>

        <h4>Question 13:</h4>
        <p>What is baking soda?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is a mild alkaline compound used in baking, cleaning, and as an antacid.</p>

        <h4>Question 14:</h4>
        <p>What is vinegar?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Vinegar is a solution of acetic acid in water, commonly used in cooking, pickling, and as a condiment.</p>

        <h4>Question 15:</h4>
        <p>How can we test the acidity or alkalinity of a solution?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>We can test the acidity or alkalinity of a solution using pH strips or indicators like litmus paper.</p>

        <h4>Question 16:</h4>
        <p>What is the effect of acid rain on the environment?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Acid rain can harm aquatic life, damage vegetation, and erode buildings and monuments.</p>

        <h4>Question 17:</h4>
        <p>What is the importance of maintaining pH in swimming pools?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Maintaining proper pH levels in swimming pools is essential for comfort, preventing skin irritation, and ensuring the effectiveness of disinfectants.</p>

        <h4>Question 18:</h4>
        <p>What is the effect of temperature on solubility?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Generally, the solubility of solids in liquids increases with temperature, while the solubility of gases decreases with an increase in temperature.</p>

        <h4>Question 19:</h4>
        <p>What is the significance of acids in digestion?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Acids, such as hydrochloric acid in the stomach, aid in the digestion of food and kill harmful bacteria.</p>

        <h4>Question 20:</h4>
        <p>Explain the importance of neutralization reactions in agriculture.</p>
