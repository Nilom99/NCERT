        <h3>Solutions to NCERT Questions</h3>

        <h4>Question 1:</h4>
        <p>What is a physical change?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>A physical change is a change in which the form or appearance of a substance changes, but its chemical composition remains the same.</p>

        <h4>Question 2:</h4>
        <p>What is a chemical change?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>A chemical change is a change that results in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties.</p>

        <h4>Question 3:</h4>
        <p>Give an example of a physical change.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>An example of a physical change is melting ice into water.</p>

        <h4>Question 4:</h4>
        <p>Give an example of a chemical change.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>An example of a chemical change is burning wood, which produces ash and smoke.</p>

        <h4>Question 5:</h4>
        <p>What are the characteristics of physical changes?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Characteristics of physical changes include reversible processes, no new substances formed, and changes in physical properties such as shape and size.</p>

        <h4>Question 6:</h4>
        <p>What are the characteristics of chemical changes?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Characteristics of chemical changes include irreversible processes, new substances formed, and changes in chemical properties.</p>

        <h4>Question 7:</h4>
        <p>How can we identify a chemical change?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>A chemical change can be identified by the release of gas, formation of a precipitate, change in color, or change in temperature.</p>

        <h4>Question 8:</h4>
        <p>What is the law of conservation of mass?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The law of conservation of mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; it is conserved.</p>

        <h4>Question 9:</h4>
        <p>What happens to substances during a chemical change?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>During a chemical change, the bonds between atoms are broken and new bonds are formed, resulting in new substances.</p>

        <h4>Question 10:</h4>
        <p>What is rusting?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Rusting is a chemical change that occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and moisture, forming iron oxide (rust).</p>

        <h4>Question 11:</h4>
        <p>What is the difference between a reactant and a product?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Reactants are the starting substances in a chemical reaction, while products are the substances formed as a result of the reaction.</p>

        <h4>Question 12:</h4>
        <p>What is fermentation?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, or alcohol in the absence of oxygen.</p>

        <h4>Question 13:</h4>
        <p>What is the significance of chemical changes in our daily life?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Chemical changes are significant in cooking, digestion, and the production of various materials and substances we use daily.</p>

        <h4>Question 14:</h4>
        <p>What role do catalysts play in chemical reactions?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Catalysts speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process, enabling reactions to occur more efficiently.</p>

        <h4>Question 15:</h4>
        <p>How can we prevent rusting?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Rusting can be prevented by applying protective coatings, using rust-resistant alloys, and storing metals in dry environments.</p>

        <h4>Question 16:</h4>
        <p>What is photosynthesis?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Photosynthesis is a chemical process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose, using carbon dioxide and water.</p>

        <h4>Question 17:</h4>
        <p>What are endothermic and exothermic reactions?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Endothermic reactions absorb heat from the surroundings, while exothermic reactions release heat.</p>

        <h4>Question 18:</h4>
        <p>What is the significance of chemical reactions in the environment?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Chemical reactions play a crucial role in environmental processes, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and energy flow.</p>

        <h4>Question 19:</h4>
        <p>What is the role of enzymes in chemical reactions?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Enzymes act as biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed.</p>

        <h4>Question 20:</h4>
        <p>How do we use chemical changes in industry?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Chemical changes are utilized in various industries for manufacturing, food processing, pharmaceuticals, and energy production.</p>
