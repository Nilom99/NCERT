        <h3>Solutions to NCERT Questions</h3>

        <h4>Question 1:</h4>
        <p>List the different parts of the human digestive system.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The human digestive system consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. Each part plays a specific role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients.</p>

        <h4>Question 2:</h4>
        <p>Explain the role of teeth in the process of digestion.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Teeth play a crucial role in the process of digestion by mechanically breaking down food into smaller pieces through chewing, which increases the surface area for enzymes to act upon during chemical digestion.</p>

        <h4>Question 3:</h4>
        <p>What are the different types of teeth in humans?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Humans have four types of teeth: incisors (for cutting), canines (for tearing), premolars (for crushing), and molars (for grinding).</p>

        <h4>Question 4:</h4>
        <p>What is the function of saliva?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Saliva helps in the digestion of carbohydrates through the enzyme amylase, moistens food for easier swallowing, and provides a medium for taste.</p>

        <h4>Question 5:</h4>
        <p>What is the significance of the stomach in digestion?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The stomach secretes gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and enzymes, which further break down food into a semi-liquid form called chyme.</p>

        <h4>Question 6:</h4>
        <p>Describe the process of absorption of nutrients.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine through villi, tiny finger-like projections that increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients then enter the bloodstream for distribution.</p>

        <h4>Question 7:</h4>
        <p>What are herbivores? Give examples.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Herbivores are animals that primarily consume plants. Examples include cows, goats, and rabbits.</p>

        <h4>Question 8:</h4>
        <p>Explain the role of the large intestine.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from indigestible food matter and compacts waste into feces for elimination from the body.</p>

        <h4>Question 9:</h4>
        <p>What is the role of the pancreas in digestion?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>The pancreas produces digestive enzymes and bicarbonate that help neutralize stomach acid in the small intestine, aiding digestion.</p>

        <h4>Question 10:</h4>
        <p>Define saprophytic nutrition.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Saprophytic nutrition is the mode of nutrition in which organisms obtain nutrients by feeding on dead and decaying organic matter. Fungi are typical examples of saprophytes.</p>

        <h4>Question 11:</h4>
        <p>What are carnivores? Give examples.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Carnivores are animals that primarily consume other animals. Examples include lions, tigers, and eagles.</p>

        <h4>Question 12:</h4>
        <p>What is a balanced diet?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>A balanced diet contains all the essential nutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals—in the right proportions to maintain health and support growth.</p>

        <h4>Question 13:</h4>
        <p>How do animals obtain nutrients?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Animals obtain nutrients by consuming food, which is then digested and absorbed into the body. Different animals have different feeding mechanisms.</p>

        <h4>Question 14:</h4>
        <p>What is the importance of dietary fibers?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Dietary fibers aid in digestion, help maintain bowel health, lower cholesterol levels, and control blood sugar levels.</p>

        <h4>Question 15:</h4>
        <p>Explain the role of bile in digestion.</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, emulsifies fats into smaller droplets, making it easier for enzymes to digest them.</p>

        <h4>Question 16:</h4>
        <p>What is the function of gastric juice?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and enzymes that help break down food, kill bacteria, and provide an acidic environment for digestive enzymes to work effectively.</p>

        <h4>Question 17:</h4>
        <p>What is absorption in the context of nutrition?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Absorption is the process by which digested nutrients pass through the walls of the intestines into the bloodstream for use by the body.</p>

        <h4>Question 18:</h4>
        <p>How do omnivores obtain nutrition?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Omnivores obtain nutrition by consuming both plant and animal-based foods, allowing them to have a diverse diet.</p>

        <h4>Question 19:</h4>
        <p>What are the symptoms of malnutrition?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Symptoms of malnutrition may include fatigue, weakness, stunted growth, and increased susceptibility to infections.</p>

        <h4>Question 20:</h4>
        <p>What is the role of enzymes in digestion?</p>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <p>Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up the digestion of food by breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, facilitating absorption.</p>
